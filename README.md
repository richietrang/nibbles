## Description

Nibbles is a free to use project that allows a user to search for available recipes given a list of ingredients. We provide a beautiful user interface that allows maximum customisability, while fully enriched with additional features such as sign up and sign in capability in order to save (or favourite) recipes and having recipes ranked by how closely matched the queries are. We believe that no food should go wasted so let Nibbles help you make a difference!
